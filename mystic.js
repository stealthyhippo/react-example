He&nbsp;began producing a public, musical journal of his journey toward personal, spiritual, and social healing, and thus Medicine for the People was born. Recently, Nahko discussed his successes, his philosophies, his music, and his life with&nbsp;Huffington Post, who called Nahko&rsquo;s music &ldquo;beautiful and stirring.&rdquo; Nahko describes his music as a mix of hip-hop and folk rock with a world message.</p>",

    "description" : "<p>Some things come to be in their own time, of their own accord. Such has been the case with The Steel Wheels. In the beginning, it was simply a matter of four young men who&rsquo;d happened to cross paths at a formative moment in each of their lives reveling in the shared experience of plucking acoustic instruments and blending their voices. But over the years, what had begun organically as a pure lark evolved into a mission: to fuse the personal with the universal, the deeply rooted past with the joys and sorrows of everyday existence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese thematic and stylistic vectors intersect powerfully on Leave Some Things Behind (released April 14 on the band&rsquo;s own Big Ring label), a deeply human, emotionally authentic work that interweaves timely songs with timeless sounds. On the album, co-produced and engineered by Ben Surratt, the four band members&mdash;lead singer/guitarist/banjo player Trent Wagler, standup bass player Brian Dickel, fiddler Eric Brubaker and mandolin player Jay Lapp&mdash;are joined on various tracks by rootsmusic luminary Tim O&rsquo;Brien, Nashville-based singer/songwriter Sarah Siskind (who co-wrote two songs and sang on another), drummer Travis Whitmore and Hammond B3 player Ethan Ballinger. Together, they&rsquo;ve wrought a work that is musically intricate and conceptually resonant, the sounds serving the songs at every moment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMemorable original tunes like the sorrowful &ldquo;Heaven Don&rsquo;t Come by Here,&rdquo; the anxious &ldquo;End of the World Again,&rdquo; the a cappella tour de force &ldquo;Promised Land,&rdquo; the indigenously metaphorical &ldquo;Find Your Mountain,&rdquo; the autobiographical &ldquo;Rescue Me, Virginia&rdquo; and the climactic &ldquo;Every Song Is a Love Song&rdquo; are bound by a plainspoken eloquence and an unforced urgency, while the dual kickers &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve Got a Fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Warm Wool, Soft Leather&rdquo; seem tailor-made for the Grand Ole Opry stage circa 1968&mdash;as if intimating some of those precious things we&rsquo;ve left behind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe band&rsquo;s genesis dates back to 2004, when Wagler, Dickel and Brubaker were college students in Harrisonburg, Virginia, which sits in the Shenandoah Valley an hour&rsquo;s drive from Charlottesville. &ldquo;The school we met at is Eastern Mennonite University,&rdquo; Wagler recalls, punctuating the reveal with a wry chuckle. &ldquo;That begs the next question, which is, &lsquo;Why in the world did you go to Eastern Mennonite University?&rsquo; One of the unique things about our band is that all four of us grew up in Mennonite families&mdash;and I hesitate to even use the word because many people who don&rsquo;t have much experience with Mennonites see that as Amish, but that&rsquo;s not accurate. It was more of a secular Mennonite upbringing. So that was where the three of us met, but we didn&rsquo;t start the band right away.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>",

    "description" : "<p>Band Bio:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The California Honeydrops don&rsquo;t just play music&mdash;they throw parties. Led by dynamic vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Lech Wierzynski, and drawing on diverse musical influences from Bay Area R&amp;B, funk, Southern soul, Delta blues, and New Orleans second-line, the Honeydrops bring vibrant energy and infectious dance-party vibes to their shows. They&rsquo;ve taken the party all over the world, playing festivals of all kinds and touring widely across North America, Europe and Australia. In 2016 the Honeydrops were honored to support Bonnie Raitt on her North America release tour&mdash;and in the past have been privileged to support the likes of B.B. King, Allen Toussaint, Buddy Guy, and Dr. John. Whether in those high-profile performances or in more intimate venues where the band itself can leave the stage and get down on the dance floor, the California Honeydrops&rsquo; shared vision and purpose remain: to make the audience dance and sing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Honeydrops have come a long way since guitarist and trumpeter Lech Wierzynkski and drummer Ben Malament started busking in an Oakland subway station, but the band has stayed true to that organic, street-level feel.&nbsp; Listening to Lech sing, it can be a surprise that he was born in Warsaw, Poland, and raised by Polish political refugees. He learned his vocal stylings from contraband American recordings of Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and Louis Armstrong, and later at Oberlin College and on the club circuit in Oakland, California. With the additions of Johnny Bones on tenor sax and clarinet, Lorenzo Loera on keyboards, and Beau Bradbury on bass, they&rsquo;ve built a powerful full-band sound to support Wierzynski&rsquo;s vocals. More like parties than traditional concerts, their shows feature extensive off-stage jamming and crowd interaction. &ldquo;The whole point is to erase the boundaries between the crowd and us,&rdquo; Wierzynski says. &ldquo;We don&#39;t make setlists. We want requests. We want crowd involvement, to make people become a part of the whole thing by dancing along, singing, picking the songs and generally coming out of their shells.&rdquo;</p>",

    "description" : "<p>The Aggrolites are more than a band they are a movement unto themselves. They carry a banner - one created with their own hands. This banner reads, &ldquo;Dirty Reggae,&rdquo; and represents their signature fusion of reggae, soul, grit and determination. For seven magnificent years, this dirty reggae bunch has rolled from city to city, across the pond and up main street USA. They rally the kids, the parents, the students, the cops, the bosses and the drifters. The people come, they relish in The Aggrolites, the dirty reggae and the joy that comes with it all. The liberating rhythms and catchy grooves demand a return trip.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOut of the Los Angeles school of hard knocks, The Aggrolites have earned a Ph.D in &quot;feel good music.&quot; On the road they educate with the thunder and punch of the reggae drums and bass, the ripping, soulful melodies of the organ and guitars, and Jesse Wagner&rsquo;s voice - a gift from the heavens, a perfectly intact gift from Otis, Sam, Ray and Wilson.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter eight years of touring the globe, The Aggrolites are proud to reveal their first live album, Unleashed Live Vol. 1. With five previous studio releases under their belt, including recently released Rugged Road, the next logical move for the band was a compilation of their favorite songs recorded live from recent shows at The Belly Up in Solana Beach, CA and The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles, CA. Unleashed Live Vol. 1 features songs from all four previous studio releases plus a version of The Beatles &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Let Me Down&rdquo; and &ldquo;Banana&rdquo; by the legendary reggae artist, Roy Ellis. Release date will be announced sometime this fall and available digitally worldwide and in select retail outlets nationwide.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Aggrolites have a specific way of making music. They don&#39;t over think it, they don&#39;t obsess over pop culture demands, they walk onto a stage or into a recording studio and let &quot;it&quot; happen - a culmination of inspiration - from the road, from playing alongside legends, and from the energy and motivation of their die hard fans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Aggrolites are Jesse Wagner (vocals, lead guitar), Roger Rivas (organ), Jeff Roffredo (bass) and Alex Mckenzie(Drums).</p>",
