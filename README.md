# react-example
proof of concept on tw api

This project uses Webpack and NPM to run the app. Webpack is responsible for creating the client.js which groups all the JS code into one file. You can relate this to grunt where it creates ecm.js which is a combination of all the JS files. 

For the sake of simplicity, I am not using Redux since that requires further research and could make the code more complex for us beginners in the world of React. 

Below is a short description for each file in this project:

Index.html - This is the base html file for the project. It contains a simple template and does nothing more than creating a div. This file is also responsible for inlcuding any external css, the mystic.js file (which is simply a JSON file with a bunch of event data. Again for simplicity using a static JSON instead of the API call) and client.min.js which is generated by webpack which is the heart and soul of our entire JS and functionality of the app. 

Mystic.js - The JSON file that contains some event data. It was copy pasted from the API as is for the first few events. Therefore, this structure mimics the actual API call structure. 

Package.json - This contains all the config info for webapack and npm. 

Webpack.config.js - This is a weback file that defines certain dependencies, plugins and output file name.
